# Mall-Customers-Clustering-using-K-Means-Clustering
Mall Customers clustering is done using K-means algorithm which is present in the scikit library in python which comes under the machine learning library.
# What does the project do 
It is the basic project of clustering and it clusters the all types of custormers in that prticular dataset and as we know that in supervised learnning we use the unsupervised learning dataset where we donot have the labelled data so, we can use the clustering algorithms to findthe similar data elements and form the clusters and by this we can furture label them for our machinne leraning takes and all.
# Why the project is useful
For unsupervised learning datasets we donot have the labels to predict or classify the labels so, we use the clustering algorithms to find the similar data elements by there similar patterns and divide them into similar groups as clusters. And this the basic method for clustering.
# How users can get started with the project 
Make sure to follow these steps inorder to avoid the errors and other consequences:
Firstly, use these commands to install libraries in command prompt:
    1) pip install pandas 
    2) pip install numpy 
    3) pip install scikit-learn 
    4) pip install matplotlib
# Where users can get help with your project 
I think there will be no issues will be raised for this project because these are the basic projects which can be executed without any  extentions.
